# US Voter Disenfranchisement: </br>How state laws stop eligible voters

Neville Fernandes, Constance McCarney, Priyanka Pandey, Kyle Riener and Tyler Young

[Brief Video Overview](https://youtu.be/2hFawQW1v2Q)

## US Voting in Theory and Practice

The foundation of a representative democracy is the vote of its citizens. The government can only truly claim to represent the people when all citizens are able to exercise their right to vote. Certainly, some individuals may make a personal choice not to vote, but this too is an expression of their right. 

The U.S. Constitution grants the right to vote to all citizens over the age of 18. However, the process of conducting fair elections and verifying the eligibility of voters is left to the states. This process creates obstacles that discourage people from voting. These obstacles may be intentional, such as laws or regulations meant to exclude, or they could simply be unintended consequences based on practices or norms thought to be fair and impartial. Regardless, the result is voter suppression and it undermines the integrity and validity of our elections and government.

While states reasonably need to determine where polling locations will be and when the polls will be open, these very practical limitations affect low-income voters differently as they may not be able to afford taking unpaid time from work in order to stand in line on election day. Voter identification laws disproportionately affect non-white and low-income voters in large parts of the US because they are less likely to have the most basic form of identification: a driver’s license. 

In 2016, 6.1 million people of voting age were made ineligible to vote by felon voting laws. According to The Sentencing Project, in all but two US states incarcerated felons, those on parole or probation, or those post-incarceration cannot vote (Uggen, Shannon, & Manza, 2010). The process to re-apply for voting rights is tedious and opaque in some states. Since people of color are incarcerated at higher rates than whites, these laws also disproportionately prevent their participation as voters. 

So what are some of the ways that states can make voting easier or more difficult? States with early voting allow voters to show up in person before election day to cast their ballots at pre-specified locations. This means a voter does not have to be concerned with any limitations or time constraints they may have for voting on election day itself. For example, if a person works on election day, but not the Saturday before, then early voting allows them to cast a vote without impacting their work schedule. 

All states allow some form of mail-in ballot. In some states this is an absentee ballot, which a voter must apply to receive. Some states allow anyone to apply, others require a person submit a valid reason, such as being a college student outside their home district. Three states conduct all mail elections, in which all voters receive a ballot in the mail for every election. Regardless, mail-in ballots help remove the location based difficulties of voting since every home essentially becomes a polling location. This has an additional benefit of giving voters more time to thoughtfully consider all the candidates and initiatives that may be on the ballot.

Finally, states may determine that when coming to a polling location a voter must show some form of identification to verify that they are in fact a registered voter for the jurisdiction. Many states did not, and still do not, require any form of identification to vote. The past several years however has seen a change in this trend with more states requiring identification or photo identification. Some states have taken this further to specify on certain valid types of identification and to severely limit the options for voters without approved identification.


## The Data

Our main data source for this project comes from surveys conducted by the US Census Bureau in 2016. We downloaded multiple files, each with demographic data points covering race, gender, income, disability, and employment for each county in the US. We merged these with the results from the 2016 election, also by county, to use as our main data file. However, county voting data was not available for Alaska, which is why this state has been excluded from our results. Information on early voting, absentee and mail-in ballots and voter ID laws came from the National Council of State Legislatures. These were tables and text that we entered into a csv file to use in our analysis. Additionally, the [2016 Sentencing Project](http://www.sentencingproject.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/6-Million-Lost-Voters.pdf) provided details on the felon voting laws and estimates of the population affected at the state level, for which there was no official source before (Uggen, Shannon, & Manza, 2010).

```{r Library and Data, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

library(tidyverse)
library(data.table)

census <- read.csv("Data/census_with_election_data.csv") %>% 
    mutate(turnout = (total_votes/X18.and.over.population)*100)

laws <- read.csv("Data/Voting Laws by State Revised.csv")

df <- left_join(census, laws, by=c('state.name'='State'))

df <- df[complete.cases(df),]

felons_all <- read.csv("Data/2016_felon_disenfranchisement_state.csv")

felons_merge <- left_join(felons_all, felons_black, by=c('State'='State'))
state_election <- read.csv("Data/state_election_data.csv")
```

Since all of the demographic information was reported as percentages of a county population, we needed to create new category variables to better isolate the effects of the voting laws on different populations of interest. As such low, middle, and high income counties were defined based on the bottom and top quartiles and counties were designated as either containing high or low for the portion of residents with a disability based on the top quartile.

Additionally, we ranked the level of difficulty that laws governing early voting, mail-in ballots and voter identification presented to voters on a scale of 1 to 3, with 3 being the most restrictive. Using these scores we created an overall score on the ease of voting in each state on a scale of 3 to 9. States scoring a 3 or 4 were categorized as flexible while states scoring an 8 or 9 were considered restrictive.

Since Alaska was excluded from the main file, we created another data file for plotting the effect of restoring voting rights to felons (re-enfranchisement). The state-level election results were sourced from [US Election Atlas](https://uselectionatlas.org/RESULTS/) and were merged with the felon data. The missing state name fields were updated and the felon data, census data and state election data were all combined into one data frame. 

```{r}

census_DT <- as.data.table(census)
census_DT[grepl("Alaska", census_DT$Geography_x)]$county <-  gsub(",.*$", "", census_DT[grepl("Alaska", census_DT$Geography_x)]$Geography)

census_state <- census_DT %>%  group_by(state.name) %>%  summarise(Population=sum(Total.population), Males=sum(Male), Females=sum(Female), VAP=sum(X18.years.and.over), VAP_Male=sum(X18.years.and.over...Male), VAP_Female=sum(X18.years.and.over...Female))

census_state <- census_state[2:52, ]

df2 <- left_join(census_state, state_election, by=c('state.name'='State'))
df2 <- left_join(df2, felons_all, by = c("state.name" = "State"))

# Removing special characters from string columns and converting them to numeric
df2 <- data.frame(lapply(df2, gsub, pattern = ",", replacement = ""))
df2 <- data.frame(lapply(df2, gsub, pattern = "%", replacement = ""))

as.numeric.factor <- function(x) {as.numeric(levels(x))[x]}
df2[, c(2:29)] <- sapply(df2[, c(2:29)], as.numeric.factor)

# Write CSV for Tableau
#write.csv(df2, file = "elections_with_all_felons.csv")

```

## County Distribution of Voter Turnout

As these distributions show, overall turnout increases in states with more flexible, voter-friendly laws. It's clear that some counties have higher turnout than others and that different voting laws do not eliminate this variation. But it also makes clear that some people do not vote, not because they do not wish to, but because they are not able to. Whether intentional or not, some states are excluding citizens from elections because of the current laws and system that make it more difficult for voters. 

![Overall County Turnout](Data/CountyTurnout.png)

```{r Graphs Overall Turnout Density, warning=FALSE}

ggplot(df, aes(x=turnout, group=VoteCate)) + 
    geom_density() +
    xlim(0,100) +
    labs(x="County voters as percentage of 18 years and older population",
         title="Flexible Voting Laws Increase Turnout",
         subtitle="In the 2016 general election, ease of voting is determined by restrictiveness of voter ID laws, number of early voting days, and vote by mail provisions.",
         caption="Sources: Population and election data from the U.S. Census Bureau. Voting laws from the National Council of State Legislatures. Excludes Alaska.") +
    annotate(geom = "text", x = c(46,74), y = c(.04,.045), label = c("Strict", "Flexible") , color="black", size=3) +
    theme_minimal() +
    theme(axis.title.y=element_blank(),
          axis.text.y=element_blank(),
          axis.ticks.y=element_blank(),
          legend.position="none",
          panel.grid.minor=element_blank(),
          panel.grid.major=element_blank())
```
In displaying this information, we've consciously chosen density plots over scatterplots or smoothed lines. We expect there to be variation in turnout across counties and by showing this in the plot we address any criticism that may come from it. But our central point remains clear, because the distribution of the voter participation is shifted right when states are more flexible, and left when they are more inflexible. The center, unlabeled distribution is well representative of the overall distribution when the state groups are not separated. We've minimized the visual clutter so that viewers can clearly read what is shown.

## Voter Turnout in Low-Income Counties

We wanted to isolate Americans who were more likely to face structural difficulties in voting because of a lack of paid time off for voting and tight budgets, or complex commutes which would make it tricky to squeeze in a stop at the polls. We plotted the distributions for education, employment type, and even commute, but ultimately we felt that what we were really looking at was differences for low-income communities versus middle or high income. 

The familiar distributions below are the voting patterns for low income counties, those with a median income in the bottom quartile of our dataset. Likely for all the reasons suggested above, more flexible voting policies remove barriers for low income voters. This casts a different light on the common characterization of people with less education or low income as non-voters, with the subtle suggestion that it is because of less education or values that they don't vote. Instead it is more likely that the costs of the voting process are too high for low income Americans.

![Low Income County Turnout](Data/LowIncomeTurnout.png)

We chose a density plot because we thought it clearly showed a difference between the different groups. We also wanted to limit unnecessary information so we removed gridlines and the y-axis, keeping only the labels for 'flexible' and 'strict'.

```{r Graphs Turnout and Income, warning=FALSE}

df %>% filter(IncomeLevels == "Low") %>% ggplot() + 
    geom_density(aes(x=turnout, group=VoteCate)) + 
    xlim(0,100) +
    labs(x="County voters as percentage of 18 years and older population",
         title="Restrictive Voting Laws Suppress Low-Income Turnout",
         subtitle="In the 2016 general election, low income counties see lower turnout when early voting days and mail-in ballots are curtailed and photo IDs are required.",
         caption="Sources: Population and election data the from U.S. Census Bureau. Voting laws from the National Council of State Legislatures. Excludes Alaska.") +
    annotate(geom = "text", x = c(47,72), y = c(.051,.052), label = c("Strict", "Flexible") , color="black", size=3) +    theme_minimal() +
    theme(axis.title.y=element_blank(),
          axis.text.y=element_blank(),

          legend.position="none",
          panel.grid.minor=element_blank(),
          panel.grid.major=element_blank())

```

## Voter Turnout in High-Income Counties

Contrary to low-income counties, high-income counties, those in the top quartile for median income, do not see much change in voter turnout. No matter how strict the voting laws are, the distribution of turnout remains similar for high-income voters. This reinforces the interpretation of the previous graph, since higher income citizens would have more flexibility from their work to go to the polls or would otherwise not need to consider the costs of voting. While it is encouraging to see such a high participation rates, the lack of representation form low-income voters becomes more stark. Low-income communities already face disadvantages in having their voices heard since they do not have the means to donate or lobby politicians. For this disadvantage to extend to the actual polling place is all the more troubling.

![High Income County Turnout](Data/HighIncomeTurnout.png)

```{r Graphs Drafts Income, warning=FALSE}

df %>% filter(IncomeLevels == "High") %>% ggplot() + 
    geom_density(aes(x=turnout, group=VoteCate)) + 
    xlim(0,100) +
    labs(x="County voters as percentage of 18 years and older population",
         title="High Income Voters are Immune to Structural Barriers",
         subtitle="Turnout in high income counties remains similar regardless of how strict voting laws are",
         caption="Sources: Population and election data the from U.S. Census Bureau. Voting laws from the National Council of State Legislatures. Excludes Alaska.") +
    theme_minimal() +
    theme(axis.title.y=element_blank(),
          axis.text.y=element_blank(),
          axis.ticks.y=element_blank(),
          legend.position="none",
          panel.grid.minor=element_blank(),
          panel.grid.major=element_blank())

```

## A note about race and ethnicity

Our data only allowed us to identify racial or ethnic make-up at a county level. This prevented us from really being able to isolate the impacts of the voting laws on African-Americans or Latinos who have faced historic disenfranchisement.


## Voter turnout and Americans with disabilities

For these graphs we have limited the data to those counties in which at least 20% of the population has a disability. Polling place inaccessibility may contribute to the lower voter turnout, both directly by making voting more difficult for people with disabilities, and indirectly by sending the message that people with disabilities are not expected to participate in the political sphere. Though disabilities are not limited to mobility, we did see that the strongest voting law impact comes when states implement all mail voting. A disability would provide a clear reason for requesting a ballot, so it is not surprising to see little difference among absentee ballot states. But the application process may be difficult for some, so by sending the ballot to voters with a disability, the state has created a more inclusive process.

## What if turnout increased...

### Narrative Improvement
In thinking about our overall narrative that voter disenfranchisement is an issue that negatively impacts America by affecting the electoral mandate, we wanted to show a scenario of what might happen if more voters had turned out for the 2016 presidential election. We then perform a deeper dive into analyzing how that can happen by looking at empowering certain slices of the voting-age population. In this case, we demonstrate how restoring voting rights to felons could increase overall turnout and affect the election results. In this particular year, a large increase in the overall turnout leads to the vote margin in the state of Florida and Michigan changing from being in Donald Trump's favor to Hillary Clinton. We find that re-enfranchisement of felons could similarly lead to Florida and Michigan flipping to Clinton. In both cases, the electoral votes from those two states hand over the election to Clinton, a Democrat. This is just one way of measuring the impact of increased voter turnout on the results and that impact could be different if some other demographic groups was analyzed. Hopefully in future years increasing the voter turnout could become a bipartisan effort because the ideal of American democracy is to give everyone the opportunity to vote and make their voice heard. Voter turnout defines elections and if the U.S. wants to truly be a representative democracy, we should be striving to have as many people show up to vote as possible.


### 1. Across all demographics (measured at county-level)

**After increase in voter turnout**

### 2. Due to re-enfranchisement of felons (measured at state-level)

Screenshots of the before- and after-scenarios are posted below and the interactive dashboard can be found [here](https://public.tableau.com/profile/neville.fernandes#!/vizhome/Felonswithvotemargins/Dashboard1):

**Before increase in voter turnout due to felon re-enfrachisement**

**After increase in voter turnout due to felon re-enfrachisement**
![Potential Election Results with increased turnout due to felon re-enfranchisement.](Data/results_yes-felons.PNG)

The first slider adjusts the hypothetical turnout of disenfranchised felons, as defined by the specific restrictions valid in each state. The second slider adjusts the hypothetical percent of that felon voting population that supports candidate Clinton. In all of the state included in this graph, the state population of disenfranchised felons is greater than the margin of votes between Trump and Clinton. 
This change is applied to each state, the hypothetical vote totals are summed up and the difference in vote totals for Trump and Clinton graphed above. Trump wins if positive (shown in red) and Clinton wins if negative (shown in blue).

If the newly enfranchised felons turnout is at 30% and 69% of them vote Democrat (Uggen and Manza, 2002), then Clinton wins a majority in Florida. Michigan flips with 70% of the felon vote, if they vote at the rate the rest of the state's population (63%). Vote turnout percentages were sourced from a 2016 report by Parlapiano and Pearce in the New York Times.

### Making of: Thoughts/Reasons
These dashboards were not part of the first version, but we will still discuss the decisions behind the 'making of' for them. The goal of these visualizations was to show that increasing voter turnout could make a significant impact on the results of the election. The two dashboards were created on Tableau and capture the impact of voter turnout (Dashboard 1 - all demographics, Dashboard 2 - re-enfranchised felons) on the 2016 presidential election results. The data for the first dashboard was sourced from the census_with_election_data CSV file and that for the second one was sourced from the elections_with_all_felons CSV file. A parameter was created in Tableau in both dashboards for increasing the percentage points in voter turnout (or re-enfranchised felons turnout), which was designed to be applied uniformly to all counties (or states). But for the first dashboard, counties were prevented from having a turnout of over 100%. If the slider is moved to 0.1, voter turnout is increased by 10 percentage points.

In the first visualization, the potential votes from that increase that would be added to a county were split amongst the candidates based on how the county had already voted. In the second visualization, the those potential votes were split according to value selected in the second control - the percentage of votes for Clinton. The difference in total votes (both actual plus potential) for each candidate is displayed on the graph. We could have graphed 2 bars for each state with the total votes for Clinton and Trump, but when trying to maximize the data-pixel-ratio, we thought it would be better to show one bar as the difference for each state and both the direction and color of the bar indicate who would have won the election. Unnecessary gridlines were also removed. Several of the swing states were added and the ability for the user to select states was also allowed.  In the first visualization, Florida and Michigan were the only two states that flipped, but other states come close as well. In the second visualization, all of the red states eventually flip to blue (i.e. Trump majority changed to Clinton majority) as both levers are changed to 100%. The reason for allowing the user to pick additional states was to prevent it from seeming biased to only picking states that flipped in Clinton's favor. In reality, a user has the ability to check that Florida and Michigan would flip with these calculations and they would both go from Trump to Clinton, therefore handing over the election to Clinton.
