# Initial data exploration and clean up

## Topic: Voter Disenfranchisement in America

We will be looking at how citizens of voting age can be, and are being disenfranchised in the United States of America from these three points of view - the citizens and groups that are being adversely affected by disenfranchisement (Who), how location plays into it the Where) and the temporal concerns that contribute to it (the When).

Our main data source for this project will be 2016 US Census data. We downloaded multiple files, each with various demographic information such as race, education and employment. We merged these together along with results from the 2016 election to use as our main data file. 

Information on mail-in and early voting was found online (http://www.ncsl.org/research/elections-and-campaigns/absentee-and-early-voting.aspx). We took this information and entered it into a .csv file to use in our analysis.
