Initial data exploration and clean up

Topic: voter disenfranchisement in America

Our main data source for this project will be 2016 US census data. We downloaded multiple files, each with various demographic information such as race, education and employment. We merged these together along with results from the 2016 election to use as our main data file. 

Information on mail-in and early voting was found online (http://www.ncsl.org/research/elections-and-campaigns/absentee-and-early-voting.aspx). We took this information and entered it into a .csv file to use in our analysis.
